# Contributing

Thanks for taking an interest. This is a small solo project, but PRs are welcome and I'll review them.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/XeldarAlz/FFXIV-AutoSightseeingLog.git
cd FFXIV-AutoSightseeingLog
dotnet build AutoSightseeingLog.sln -c Release
```

You need the .NET 10 SDK. The plugin requires Dalamud at runtime; CI pulls a Dalamud dev build automatically and that's enough to compile. See `.github/workflows/release.yml` if you want to reproduce CI locally.

Load the built plugin via `/xlsettings` -> **Experimental** -> **Dev Plugin Locations**, pointing at `AutoSightseeingLog/bin/Release/AutoSightseeingLog.dll`.

## Project layout

- `AutoSightseeingLog/Core/`: vista data, the log reader, Eorzea time and weather, the automation state machine.
- `AutoSightseeingLog/Windows/`: ImGui main window, settings, dependencies.
- `AutoSightseeingLog/`: plugin entry points, config, command wiring.
- `ECommons/`: submodule, shared Dalamud helpers. Don't patch this directly; upstream it.

Keep logic small and direct. This plugin has one job.

## Before you open a PR

1. `dotnet build -c Release` cleanly.
2. Test in-game on at least one vista per expansion you touched. Positions, time windows, and weather rules differ between expansions, so a fix that works for Dawntrail may not work for A Realm Reborn.
3. Keep the diff focused. One concern per PR.
4. Match the existing style. No heavy abstractions "for later."
5. If your change affects what a user sees or types (commands, window layout, settings), update the README.
6. If you used AI beyond autocomplete, say which level in the PR description. It is one line, and [AI-USAGE.md](AI-USAGE.md) explains the level names and why I ask.

## Good first issues

Check the tracker for anything labeled `good first issue`. Vista-specific quirks (a spot the plugin can't reach, a vista that never records, a wrong time window) are usually the lowest-friction way to help: name the vista by its log number, attach a log of what the plugin did vs. what should have happened, and a fix is usually a small change.
